                <div style="line-height: 1.7; color: #374151;">
                    <p>One of the most common questions we receive at our Buffalo workshop is about the heat resistance of our handmade resin coasters. As a Western New York artisan who's been crafting wood and resin pieces for years, I want to give you the complete picture of what our coasters can handle and how to care for them properly.</p>

                    <h2>The Short Answer: Yes, But With Limits</h2>
                    
                    <p>Our resin coasters are designed to handle typical beverage temperatures with ease. Your morning coffee, afternoon tea, or evening hot chocolate will be perfectly safe on our handcrafted coasters. The high-quality epoxy resin we use in our Buffalo workshop can comfortably handle temperatures up to 200°F (93°C), which covers virtually all beverage serving temperatures.</p>

                    <h2>What Makes Our Resin Heat Resistant?</h2>
                    
                    <p>At Midnight's Woodworking, we use premium epoxy resin specifically chosen for its durability and heat resistance. This isn't the cheap craft store variety – we invest in professional-grade materials that can withstand the daily use our Buffalo customers expect. The resin cures to a hard, glass-like finish that maintains its integrity under normal use conditions.</p>

                    <p>The wood component of our coasters also plays a role in heat distribution. The natural wood helps dissipate heat across the surface, preventing hot spots that could potentially damage the resin. This combination of materials creates a coaster that's both beautiful and functional for Western New York homes.</p>

                    <h2>What to Avoid</h2>
                    
                    <p>While our coasters handle beverage temperatures beautifully, there are some things to avoid. Don't place items directly from the stove, oven, or microwave on your resin coasters. Cast iron pans, ceramic dishes straight from the oven, or anything over 200°F should go on trivets or hot pads instead.</p>

                    <p>This isn't unique to resin coasters – even stone and ceramic coasters have temperature limits. The key is understanding what your coasters are designed for: protecting your furniture from beverage rings and adding beauty to your Buffalo home.</p>

                    <h2>Real-World Testing in Buffalo</h2>
                    
                    <p>Living in Buffalo, we know our coasters need to handle everything from steaming hot coffee during those cold winter mornings to iced drinks during our beautiful summers. We've tested our coasters with:</p>

                    <ul style="margin: 1rem 0; padding-left: 2rem;">
                        <li>Fresh coffee at 160-180°F</li>
                        <li>Hot tea and cocoa</li>
                        <li>Heated mugs from the microwave</li>
                        <li>Warm soup bowls</li>
                        <li>Cold beverages with condensation</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>In every case, our coasters performed flawlessly, protecting furniture while maintaining their beautiful appearance.</p>

                    <h2>Care Tips for Longevity</h2>
                    
                    <p>To keep your Midnight's Woodworking coasters looking beautiful for years:</p>

                    <ul style="margin: 1rem 0; padding-left: 2rem;">
                        <li>Clean with mild soap and warm water</li>
                        <li>Dry immediately after washing</li>
                        <li>Avoid abrasive cleaners or scrubbers</li>
                        <li>Store in a dry place when not in use</li>
                        <li>Use coaster holders to prevent scratching</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Buffalo Bills Game Day Ready</h2>
                    
                    <p>Our Buffalo Bills-inspired coasters are particularly popular during football season. They've handled countless game day gatherings, from hot wings fresh from the oven (on proper serving dishes, of course) to cold Labatt Blue bottles. The team colors stay vibrant, and the resin surface wipes clean easily after even the most enthusiastic celebrations.</p>

                    <h2>Custom Orders and Heat Resistance</h2>
                    
                    <p>When you order custom coasters from us, whether it's for a Hamburg wedding, an Orchard Park housewarming, or a West Seneca business, you can be confident that heat resistance is built into every piece. We use the same high-quality materials and techniques for all our work, ensuring consistent performance across our entire product line.</p>

                    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
                    
                    <p>Your Midnight's Woodworking resin coasters are designed to handle real-world use in Buffalo homes. They'll protect your furniture from hot beverages while adding a touch of Western New York pride to your décor. Just remember they're coasters, not trivets – treat them with the same care you'd give any quality home accessory.</p>

                    <p>If you have specific questions about heat resistance or want to discuss a custom order, don't hesitate to reach out. We're always happy to talk about our craft and help you choose the perfect pieces for your home.</p>
